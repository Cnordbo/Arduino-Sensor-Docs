# Arduino Sensor Documentation
Documentation and Examples for various arduino sensors and components! 

# How to contribute
1) Fork
2) Create a folder with the sensor name
3) include a `README` file with a description of the sensor / component, and any special setup needed. 
    1) Include, if possible, example use cases. 
4) Create a `.ino` sketch with your code. 
5) Include a Fritzing image of your circuit.

# Coding rules
1) Component \ Sensor should only document itself, and should therefore not include any other sensors / modules. 
2) Code should not be copied from any media source that might be protected by copyright. 
3) Document your code so it can be read by a beginner arduino user with basic knowledge. 
4) Any special libraries needed should be documented in the `README`
