# 3-color LED (KY-016)
A 3-color LED which displays RED,GREEN and BLUE based on which of the pins that the current flows trough.
The module also allows for current to flow trough all three signal pins, blending RED, GREEN and BLUE color to make most of the colors on the color spectrum. 
We can also utilize PWM (Pulse-width modulation) to control the brightness of each color 

# Sample Code
Demonstrates the different states of a RGB LED by connecting the cathode to ground and giving a signal (applying current) to the three signal pins with a variety of PWM signals.
