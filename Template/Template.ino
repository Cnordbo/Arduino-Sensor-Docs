  Demonstrates Common-Cathode LED

  Demonstrates the different states of a Common-Cathode LED by connecting 
  the cathode to ground and giving a signal (applying current) to the two signal pins.

  Board: 
  * Arduino UNO

  The circuit:
  * 330 Ohm resistor
  * KY-029 - Common-Cathode RED&GREEN LED / Yin Yi 2-color LED 3mm
  * 3 x MALE-MALE Jumper Wires
