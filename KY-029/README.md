# Common-cathode RED&GREEN LED (KY-029)
A common-cathode RED&GREEN LED which displays either GREEN or RED based on which of the pins that the current flows trough.
The module also allows for current to flow trough both signal pins, blending RED and GREEN color to make Orange. (Which is different then [KY-011](../KY-011/) which only allows for a single color at any time)

# Sample Code
Demonstrates the different states of a Common-Cathode LED by connecting the cathode to ground and giving a signal (applying current) to the two signal pins.
