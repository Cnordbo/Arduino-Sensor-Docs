# 2-color LED Module 3mm (KY-011)
A 2 color LED which displays either GREEN or RED based on which of the pins that the current flows trough.
The module only allows for current to flow trough a single signal pin at any time, which is different from [KY-029](../KY-029/) which allows for blending of the two colors.

# Sample Code
Demonstrates the different states of a Common-Cathode LED by connecting the cathode to ground and giving a signal (applying current) to the two signal pins.
